# Impact-of-COVID-19-on-Global-Health-and-Economy
This project explores the impact of COVID-19 on global health and economy using real-world datasets from Our World in Data. The main goal was to forecast new COVID-19-related deaths and understand how factors like healthcare capacity, testing, and vaccination influenced outcomes, especially in India. After cleaning and visualizing the data, I applied three models: ARIMA, XGBoost, and LSTM. Each model was tested for its accuracy in predicting future deaths. While ARIMA worked well for linear trends, XGBoost showed strong performance with structured data (RÂ²: 0.92), but the LSTM model performed best by capturing complex, time-based patterns. Feature engineering techniques like correlation heatmaps, Random Forest, and SelectKBest were used to identify important variables. The results showed clear relationships between testing, cases, and deaths, and emphasized how timely interventions and strong healthcare systems helped reduce the impact. This project highlights how machine learning can support health planning and can be scaled for real-time forecasting in future health crises.
